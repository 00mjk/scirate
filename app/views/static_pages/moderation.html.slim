  h1 Comment moderation policy
  p SciRate comments are moderated according to guidelines. The moderators reserve the right to edit or delete comments that they feel do not follow these guidelines.

  p The main goal of the moderation policy is simply to keep a high quality of
    scientific discourse within an inclusive community.

  p All comments must be in line with the <a href="/conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.

  p  Sometimes, comments will be lightly edited to correct for typos or grammar mistakes, or for mathematics that isnâ€™t typesetting correctly in MathJax. Spam comments, slanderous or insulting comments, trolling or incivility, and comments judged to be crackpot will be edited or deleted.
