  h1 Comment moderation policy
  p SciRate comments are moderated according to guidelines. The moderators reserve the right to edit or delete comments that they feel do not follow these guidelines.
  p The main goal of the moderation policy is simply to keep a high quality of scientific discourse.
  p We are happy to have some amount of jovial or lighthearted comments, but these will typically be removed from the front-page feed (though typically not deleted). Sometimes, comments will be lightly edited to correct for typos or grammar mistakes, or for mathematics that isnâ€™t typesetting correctly in MathJax. Spam comments, slanderous or insulting comments, trolling or incivility, and comments judged to be crackpot will be edited or deleted.
