  h1 About
  p SciRate is a feed aggregator and social networking site for academic papers
    from <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a>. Users subscribe to the topics
    they are interested in, and papers from each day are displayed in order of
    how many Scites, or votes, they receive. This makes it easy to find papers
    which the community considers particularly interesting and significant.</p>

  p This implementation should be considered a beta. SciRate is free and open
    source software, built
    with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>. Please
    visit <a href="http://github.com/draftable/scirate3">github.com/draftable/scirate3</a>
    to view the source or help out with development. We welcome contributors!

  p The original idea for SciRate came from <a href="http://dabacon.org/">Dave
    Bacon</a>. It was then prototyped
    by <a href="http://intractable.ca/bill">Bill Rosgen</a>
    and <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~aram/">Aram Harrow</a>, and is currently
    being maintained and developed
    by <a href="https://draftable.com">Draftable</a>.</p>
