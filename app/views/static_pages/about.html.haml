    Scirate is a social networking site for academic papers from
    = succeed "." do
      %a{:href => "http://arxiv.org"} arXiv.org
    The list of papers from each day is displayed in order of the
    number of Scites, or votes, that each paper receives.

    This implementation of Scirate should be considered a beta:
    currently only
    %a{:href => "http://arxiv.org/archive/quant-ph"} quant-ph
    is supported,
    but other categories will be added in the future.

    Scirate is the idea of
    = succeed "," do
      %a{:href => "http://dabacon.org/"} Dave Bacon
    but the
    %a{:href => "http://scirate.com/"} original implementation
    has been down
    for some time.
    This implementation of Scirate is due to
